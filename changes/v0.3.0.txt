    Added a special set of functions called Loaders. They're designed
    to replace the Database object and its various functions for
    loading data files.
    
    Loaders are now designed to populate Managers.
    
    This kind of obfuscates the need for the MUD object, too. I'll
    probably restructure again in a bit.

    Laid some of the groundwork for changing the way objects are saved and loaded.

    Added a MapObjectFactory to disambiguate object loading functions
    from either the Template or the MapObject.
    
    The MapObject can't be allowed to know about its children because
    it creates a cyclical reference, which I am trying specifically
    to avoid here in this change.
    
    Templates now have names instead of number IDs. You can basically
    think of it as a string ID, but I changed it to name cause I felt
    like it.
    
    Templates can now refer to objects that refer to other objects.
    As of right now it only works for the contents of an object.
    In future it can be adapted to do other stuff. :)
