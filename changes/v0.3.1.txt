    Fixed some issues with models and templates not loading properly.
    
    Added macros for numpad / directions. Not perfect. Will fix later.

    MODELS:
    -------
    Added a concept of models, which use templates to create a fully
    fleshed out instance of an object in the game.
    
    For example, the HobGoblin template will inform the basic parameters
    of what a HobGoblin is, while the "Keith the HobGoblin" model will
    have things like what equipment he's wearing, what items are in his
    inventory, and things like that.
    
    Objects that have a template or a model shouldn't save their
    constructor -- the model and template will do that for us.
    
    I've also set it up so models and templates can be stored in
    arbitrary sub directores in order to help with organizing different
    groups. I'll have to set it up so that when saving a model/template,
    it uses the name to determine where to save it. As it stands, the
    name of a model/template should indicate the subdirectory tree.
    i.e. the Weapon.excalibur template should be saved in
    /data/template/Weapon/excalibur. Same for models.
    
    I did this for 2 reasons:
    1) It makes sense to have basic types with nothing associated with
       them.
    
    2) It makes it easier to deal with since all basic types will be
       loaded as Templates before I used them in Models. This means
       I don't have to do any extra pre-processing to avoid
       things like loading them out of order.

    MUD is now a static class singleton.
    
    Not sure how useful it is right about now.
