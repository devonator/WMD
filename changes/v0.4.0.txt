    Added CombatActions. Essentially just verbs for combat actions. Punch, kick, etc...
    
    Working on a bunch of crap.

    Fixed unit tests.
    
    Engage command is also kill.
    
    Kill command does nothing if you're already in combat.
    
    If stats are maxxed, doesn't save. When loading, if stats aren't set, sets to max.
    Setting race/class no longer updates stats.

    Working on the fundamentals of the combat system.
    
    It's pretty sloppy right now. I added an Engage command that initiates
    combat and gets a free round off. Then a round cycles every 3 seconds.
    Combat rounds cycle globally, so it's every 3 seconds starting from
    12:00:00 GMT 1970, not from when you start a fight. This ensures
    combat is equal for every mob in the game.
    
    Might have to mess with the CombatManager and how I'm adding/removing
    from it, and how I'm managing mob.fighting.

    Added shields. Currently are worth 3 pieces of equal level armor.
    Later on, I want shields to provide a flat % of damage mitigation.
    
    As it stands, strength is too strong. It provides 3 direct combat
    attributes -- health and defense which reduce incoming damage, and
    attack power which increases outgoing damage.
    
    Agility only provides 2 combat attributes. Each of them modify hit
    and evasion chances, but 50% evasion rate isn't good enough if you
    die in 1 hit. It's also not good enough to have 50% evasion rate if
    you have to trade off 50% of your attack damage. Since that means
    you will do 0 damage to someone with double your defense. Woo, I evade
    90% of attacks, but I do 0 damage. Worthless.
    
    I think I need to trade off some strength for agility-based classes
    to attack power.

    You can only wear Equipment items now. I was trying to keep parity
    with old MUDs where you can "hold" non-equipment items. But I see
    no reason to keep that feature.
    
    Created Outfit command that creates some generic equipment.
    
    Equipment has an "item level" that is meant to balance content.
    Level 1 items are designed for level 1 characters, level 5 items
    for level 5 characters, etc... this ensures, from a design
    perspective, that numbers stay in a relative range that will make
    unbalanced items more obvious.
    
    Armor provides 1 defense and 0.333 defense per level.
    Weapon provides 1 attack power and 0.333 attack power per level.
    These values can be changed for potentially "higher tier" items,
    but preferably not much.
    
    Added error message to MapObjectFactor for invalid constructor names.
    
    Renamed `wear(equipment)` and `remove(equipment)` to `equip` and `unequip`.
    `remove` is already a function on all MapObjects that removes things from
    its contents. Guess I forgot about that. Haha.

    Working on balance stuff.
    
    1 attribute point is too valuable, so I set it up so classes get 1.75 attribute
    points to assign per level, and 20 to assign to starting attributes.
    
    Added specifiers to array keyword searches; 2.ex finds the 2nd match
    to "ex" in the array.

    Added an Attributes object for more uniform access to mob attribute-related stuff.
    
    Added Array.pick function. Pretty sweet.
