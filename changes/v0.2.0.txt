    MASSIVE overhaul of concepts in the source.
    
    I've added a class of objects called managers to avoid cyclical requirements.
    What'll happen is the Database class will read files, and then pass them to the
    individual managers. The races will go to the race manager, classes to class
    manager, etc...
    
    This way, when you want to know who is online, you can just ask for the
    PlayerManager instead of asking for the entire framework for loading
    every single type of data from the local database (of JSON files).
    
    Not totally done (need to make a reference aka helpfile manager).
    This manager will include stuff like the greeting and the MOTD.
    
    Added direction flags and an object for manipulating them.

    Just wanted to make this a little more gross.

    Working more on template stuff.
    
    Created a score command for fun.
    It's kinda ugly.

    Working on templates. I like the concept a lot.
    
    A template is basically two parts: the constructor and the
    "prototype" of the full object. The prototype is an instance of
    the base object type with all of its unique attributes set as
    properties on the prototype.
    
    When spawning an instance of a template, it creates a second object
    of the same base type, then assigns the "prototype" instance as the
    instance's __proto__ attribute.

    Changed login/logut on Player and Mob. login is always called before
    the split, and logout is always called after the split. This ensures
    it's always called in a context where you can reference the old
    value.

    Renamed PlayerData to CharacterData.
    
    Moved stock commands to /src/mud/command/ instead of /data/command.
    Since they are literal source files, they belong in /src IMO.

    I've opted to just make Communicate.act() require mobs.
    
    I'm ready to move on from this.

    Restructured the source files a bit.
    
    Messed with Act and added some tests.
    
    Other stuff too.

    Added generic toString stuff for MapObject and MapObject inheriters.

    re-added commands test -- using legit socket.io clients to manage
    connections. for some reason it seems really difficult to connect
    a fake player locally. will work on that later.
    
    Channels are currently using an Act-like format object, but for
    now it'll just be "you say %s" for first person and "%s says %s"
    for third person.

    This commit is not very good.
    
    I added the Act class, which is just a collection of functions
    dedicated to describing actions to lists of mobs. This will be
    used for combat, movement, and social things.
    
    I added a system that loads channels from JSON files in the
    `/data/channel` folder. I'm not really sure if I want to load them
    like this, and I have to differentiate between required/unrequired
    channels (i.e. you can't leave the announcement channel).
    
    I also have to differentiate between COMMANDS that use channels and
    the channels themselves. So I'll have to write the OOC.json channel
    template, then I'll have to make the OOC command, and the OOC
    command has to find the OOC channel and then call `channel.chat()`.
    
    I had some serious issues with my command unit-tests, as I cannot find
    an acceptable way of ordering the tests. I'm also having trouble figuring
    out how to make sure the full /unit-tests/net test has completed before
    starting the next one. The old player is still around for quite some time
    despite being closed manually.
    
    I've deleted the /unit-tests/commands test, cause I couldn't get it to
    run after the MUD is fully loaded. Not sure how to get it to do so
    either. Oh well.
    
    Other issues here, but I can't remember and I'm too tired to keep thinking
    about the myriad issues I had.

    Messing with a new concept on command error handling.
    
    Adding channels for handling communication.
    
    Added message categories. Categories are sent to the client.
    Instead of the server sending a linebreak to the client if
    the last message is a different category, processing will be
    handled entirely on the client's side. This allows for more
    flexibility on the user interface side.
